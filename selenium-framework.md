*User Story*

A user story is a limited set of funcaitonality that the team feels comfortable implementing over the course of a single
iteration. These are tiny slices through the functionality. Usually a team strives to implement several user stories in 
one iteration. The business representive or product owner is responsible for defining stories.

*Story Card*

User stories are usually written on real cards. During the iteration, the cards are put onto the team's taskboard.

*Refactoring*

Refactoring is changing the structure of the source code without changing what it does. Usually I refactor codes before
introducing changes. By refactoring the code, I make the task of implementing the upcoming changes more easy.

*TDD*

In test-driven developement you write one single test that fails, write just enough code that make the failing test case
pass and all the other passed test case still passes. And then refactor your code to prepare it for the next tiny step.
TDD is a design approach and helps users write better code, because testable code is written by default.
